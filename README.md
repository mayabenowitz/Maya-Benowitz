## About  

In 2015 I graduated with a BS in Physics (with a distinction in research) from Utah State University. Under the supervision of [David Peak](https://physics.usu.edu/people/faculty-logan/david-peak), I proposed and proved an original theorem at the intersection of spectral graph theory and operator theory for my Bachelor's thesis. I am currently extending this result for applications in machine learning with informal mentorship from David Peak.  

In 2016 I did a post-bacc at the University of Iowa in the Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics under the supervision of [Janice Robertson](https://robertson.lab.uiowa.edu/) and [Michael Schnieders](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/biochemistry/profile/michael-schnieders). While there, I had the opportunity to spear-head a membrane protein engineering project and a new spectral method for MD analysis.

Prior to my graduation, I worked at the [Center for Nanoscale Materials and Biointegration](https://cas.uab.edu/cnmb/) under the supervision of [Lufang Zhou](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/cardiovascular/faculty/95-lufang-zhou) and in the [Atmospheric Lidar Observatory](https://cass.usu.edu/observatories/atmospheric-lidar) under the supervision of [Vincent Wickwar](https://physics.usu.edu/people/faculty-logan/vince-wickwar).   

## Research Interests & Philosophy  

Much of my work focuses on importing insights and tools from fundamental and statistical physics for physics-based simulations and machine learning applications in computational biology and biophysics. Specifically, my work lies at the intersections of algorithmic spectral graph theory, chemical graph theory, operator theory, group theory, information theory, and random matrix theory. The central theme of my research embodies a highly multidisciplinary approach in finding deep connections between --- mathematics, physics, machine learning, and biology --- with the aim of pushing new frontiers and developing novel applications at the intersections thereof. I envision a future of _antidisciplinary_ research where fruitful interactions between the disciplines and their respective fields pave the road to a universal learning algorithm --- and, with it, a biological industrial revolution.

>This paper is centered around a theorem connecting spectral graph theory with operator theory using insights from fundamental physics (Hilbert spaces) and statistical physics (power-laws). This theorem allows these two formerly disparate fields to communicate with one another using a unified language. As a consequence, new tools for the machine learner's toolkit (including graph distances and graph kernels) emerge --- computable in polynomial time --- and therefore applicable in chem-and-bioinformatics.

>Using tools from random matrix theory, information theory, and group theory this poster outlines a new spectral methodology for the computation of thermodynamic entropy from MD simulations in linear time. We transform Hamiltonian dynamical systems to an orthonormal eigenbasis of the gyration matrix and its momentum analog. We compute thermodynamic entropy in two steps: 1) by treating the gyration matrix and its momentum analog as Gaussian random variables, we construct normal distributions over an orthonormal eigenbasis of phase space and 2) we then calculate the joint Shannon entropy of these distributions.

>Using tools from random matrix theory and information theory, this poster outlines a new spectral methodology for the computation of conformational entropies from MD simulations in linear time. The spectrum of the gyration matrix (which describes random walks) contains information of the shape of the polymer. We compute conformational entropies in two steps: 1) by treating the gyration matrix as a Gaussian random variable, we construct normal distributions on the "space of all possible shapes" and 2) we then calculate the Shannon entropy of these distributions.

> In my thesis, using inisghts from fundamental physics and statistical physics, I propose and prove a new theorem at the intersection of spectral graph theory and operator theory --- opening the door to studying graphs with the tools of continuous mathematics. I use this theorem to generalize several centrality measures.

> In this poster, Mitoview633 (a new far-red fluorophore) is characterized with respect to TMRM in cardiomyocyte and H9C2 cells. We obtain the emission and absorption spectrums of Mitoview633, perform co-localization, photobleaching, and FCCP depolarization studies.  

## Personal Background  

I am a Jewish transwoman with humble beginnings. I began my academic career in one of the lowest-ranked high schools in the US. I am a first-generation STEM graduate and a soon-to-be first-generation post-graduate. To this end, I seek to inspire the next generation of STEM students from underrepresented minorities and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is a personal mission of mine to seek brilliantly creative individuals in unexpected places and foster supportive environments for their intellectual growth. I envision a future where the richness in diversity and inclusion --- both culturally and intellectually --- ignites the imaginations of our next generation of thought leaders.
