### Research Interests & Philosophy  

Much of my work focuses on importing insights and tools from fundamental and statistical physics for physics-based simulations and machine learning applications in computational biology and biophysics. Specifically, my work lies at the intersections of algorithmic spectral graph theory, chemical graph theory, operator theory, group theory, and random matrix theory. The central theme of my research embodies a highly multidisciplinary approach in finding deep connections between mathematics, physics, machine learning, and biology with the aim to push new frontiers and develop novel applications at the intersections thereof.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mayabenowitz/portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mayabenowitz/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
